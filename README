I.    WHAT IS NETMON?

It is meant to probe hosts for availability on TCP ports.



II.   WHY NETMON?

I wanted a minimalistic program compatible with Windows and Linux out of the
box - Shinken is perfect but Windows compatibility is done to the expense of
massive compatibility layers. Also I wanted something small and easy to
configure.



III.  LICENCE

See COPYING file that comes along with the package the program belongs to.



IV.   COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION

- Linux

The file of name INSTALL, distributed with netmon source files, gives
instructions to compile and install the program, using the usual
    ./configure
    make
    make install
sequence.
This INSTALL file is the one provided by default by autotools.

- Windows

You have to install Mingw and run
    mingw32-make.exe -f makefile.gcc
Mingw is licensed under GPL mostly (as of beginning of 2012), its homepage is
    http://www.mingw.org

Borland was not tested, neither Visual C++. If ever used, one showstopper to
fix will be the getopt library, used to parse long options.

Mingw makefile generation

    There is no need to recreate makefile.gcc, if ever you wish to do it any
    way, you have to install Bakefile and run the batch
        gen-win-makefile.cmd
    Bakefile is a system allowing multi-platforms control of compilation, you
    can find it here:
        http://www.bakefile.org
